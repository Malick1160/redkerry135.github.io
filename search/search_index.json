There are two ways we can go about moving the save, one way is through the save manager Checkpoint, another way is through a file manager called GM9 (GodMode9) What you need: A 3DS with Luma3DS CFW A legally dumped .nds file. If you haven't dumped your cart, a guide to dumping is here. Godmode9/Checkpoint Checkpoint instructions On your 3DS, open Checkpoint and wait for the cartridge to load. Select the DS Cartridge and press L to back up the save. Close Checkpoint and turn off your 3DS. Eject the SD Card and insert it into your computer. Look for the folder which contains your .nds backups. Inside this folder, make another folder named saves. On your computer, navigate to 3ds > Checkpoint > saves > (your DS cart's name) and copy the backed up save to the saves folder in the folder where your .nds backups are located. Rename the save file so it matches the name of the .nds file. Test out your new save in TWiLightMenu++. GM9 instructions Open gm9 by holding start and powering on. Navigate to the [C:] GAMECART drive and press A to open it. GM9 takes a while to open the gamecart drive, if you find yourself waiting for the contents to load for up to a minute, check if your cart can be read by the console normally. Create a folder in the directory of your dump (press R + Y in the directory to make a folder) and name the folder to saves, then copy the .sav file from the [C:] GAMECART drive to the saves folder. Rename the .sav by pressing R + X and rename it so it matches the name of the dump. You may use a notepad app or paper to note down the name so you can remember it.

Faketik.3dsx Instructions: Section 1: Setting up the new console Install Luma3DS CFW from this guide if it is not already installed. Do not install the cias or make a NAND Backup on Finalizing Setup Put faketik.3dsx inside your broken console's 3ds folder, but do not run it. Extracting the movable file from essential.exefs Insert your SD Card to your computer and retrieve the essential.exefs from when you made a NAND Backup on your previous broken console. Put the essential.exefs anywhere on the SD Card (for now, just put it on the SD Card's root) Eject your SD Card and insert it into your new 3DS console. Boot GodMode9 by holding Start, then press Power. Press A on [0:] SDCARD Select your essential.exefs , and press A on Mount as EXEFS image . Look for a file named movable inside the essential.exefs image mount. Copy the movable file to the root of your SD Card. There are two possible ways to do this step: i. Go back to GM9's main menu, press R + START to power off, and eject the SD Card and insert it in your computer. ii. Press R + X to rename the file. Rename the movable file to movable.sed . Replacing the movable.sed (if you did part i, eject the SD Card and insert it into your 3DS, and boot GM9.) Navigate to [1:] SYSNAND CTRNAND > private and delete the movable.sed file that is found in there. Press B until you are back at GM9's main menu. Locate your renamed movable.sed in [0:] SDCARD and copy it to [1:] SYSNAND CTRNAND > private Press B until you're back at GM9's main menu, then press R and A simultaneously and select Fix CMACs for drive.

A 3DS Cartridge with a save in it. A digital version of the 3DS Cartridge, either obtained through Cartinstall or a legal cartridge dump. There must be a save file in this version. If there isn't a save file, make one in-game. An SD Card adapter (ftp with ftpd works if necessary) Basic Checkpoint controls (this section is directed to those whose SELECT button(s) are broken) Use the DPad or Circle Pad to navigate around the app. Press A to select a game. After selecting a game, you can press L to backup the save, or R to restore the save. You can also enable cheats for the selected game. Usage guide here .
