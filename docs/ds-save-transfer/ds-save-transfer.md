This tutorial will guide you through moving a DS cart's save to TWiLightMenu++. There are two ways we can go about moving the save, one way is through the save manager Checkpoint, another way is through a file manager called GM9 (GodMode9)

## What you need:
A 3DS with Luma3DS CFW
A legally dumped .nds file. If you haven't dumped your cart, a guide to dumping is here.
Godmode9/Checkpoint

### Checkpoint instructions
1. On your 3DS, open Checkpoint and wait for the cartridge to load.
2. Select the DS Cartridge and press L to back up the save.
3. Close Checkpoint and turn off your 3DS.
4. Eject the SD Card and insert it into your computer.
5. Look for the folder which contains your .nds backups.
6. Inside this folder, make another folder named saves.
7. On your computer, navigate to 3ds > Checkpoint > saves > (your DS cart's name) and copy the backed up save to the saves folder in the folder where your .nds backups are located.
8. Rename the save file so it matches the name of the .nds file.
9. Test out your new save in TWiLightMenu++.


### GM9 instructions
1. Open gm9 by holding start and powering on.
2. Navigate to the [C:] GAMECART drive and press A to open it. GM9 takes a while to open the gamecart drive, if you find yourself waiting for the contents to load for up to a minute, check if your cart can be read by the console normally.
3. Create a folder in the directory of your dump (press R + Y in the directory to make a folder) and name the folder to saves, then copy the .sav file from the [C:] GAMECART drive to the saves folder.
4. Rename the .sav by pressing R + X and rename it so it matches the name of the dump. You may use a notepad app or paper to note down the name so you can remember it.
5. Test out your save file in TWiLightMenu++.
